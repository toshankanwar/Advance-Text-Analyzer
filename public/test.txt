How to generate actual 5000 unique lines:

Every line above is unique and demonstrates different content types (numbers, emails, URLs, punctuation, palindromes, mixed cases, spaces, and more).
To get the full file, use the above as a template and expand with a simple Python script to generate actual lines from 28 to 4990, ensuring each one is unique (different emails, URLs, numbers, palindromes, etc.).
Copilot said: ### PDF Parsing Limits **How many lines can
PDF Parsing Limits
How many lines can it parse?
With the method using pdfjs-dist in your React app, you can parse the entire contents of a PDF, regardless of the number of lines or pages, as long as:

The PDF isn’t extremely huge (hundreds of MBs), which may crash the browser or use too much memory.
The browser has enough memory to process the file (most PDFs up to 50MB are fine for parsing text).
For a typical results sheet PDF (like marksheets, scorecards, etc.), the parser will extract all visible text from all pages.

Searching for a Name in a PDF
Once the PDF text is extracted (which your app does and puts in the textarea), you can search for any name using:

Manual search: Use your browser’s "Find" feature (Ctrl+F).
Automated search: You can add a feature in your app to search for a name and highlight it in the text.
For example:
If you upload a results sheet PDF and want to find "John Doe", just type "John Doe" in your "Keyword to highlight" field, and click "Highlight" — your app will highlight every occurrence.

If you want to automatically check if a name exists and show a message ("Found" or "Not Found"), you could add a function like:

JavaScript
function isNamePresent(text, name) {
  return text.toLowerCase().includes(name.toLowerCase());
}
And display the result in your UI.

Summary
PDF parsing in your app can handle all lines/pages for normal-sized PDFs.
You can search for any name once the text is extracted, either manually or via your app’s highlight/search feature.
For very large PDFs, performance depends on browser resources, but for normal results sheets, it works perfectly.
If you want code for an automated name search with result display, let me know!
